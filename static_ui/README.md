static_ui
==========================

This is an extension that allows a Druid node to serve up some static content under the path `druid/v1/ui`.
For example, you could have a single-page web app (like that generated by github.com/yahoo/druid-dashboard) 
that knows how to communicate with a Druid node served up which provides a dashboard.

The extension serves up files that are in the `static_ui` directory on the classpath.  So, instead of
providing a config value that tells it which directory to look in, you need to manage your classpath such that
there exists a `static_ui/` directory with the various static assets that you want served.

Content-types of files is determined by using the Tika library to examine the extension of the file being served.

This can be used alongside the github.com/yahoo/druid-dashboard repository to provide a generic-ish dashboard
against any Druid cluster.  Steps to do that are

1. Follow the steps in github.com/yahoo/druid-dashboard, but build the ember application using
    ```
    ember build --environment production
    ```
2. Copy the generated `dist` folder into, e.g. the directory `conf/static_ui`
3. Add the directory `conf` to your classpath and include this module.
4. If you hit /druid/v1/ui it should load the dashboard
